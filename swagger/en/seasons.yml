    - Use the platform shard when making stadia requests, requests for PC and PS4 players' season stats for seasons after division.bro.official.2018-09, and for Xbox season stats for seasons after division.bro.official.2018-08. Use the platform-region shard for making any other requests for players' season stats.<br><br>
    - The list of seasons can be queried using both the plaform shard and the platform-region shard.<br><br>
